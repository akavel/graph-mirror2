        which directory you want to install Graph. The installation will add a 
        shortcut to Start-&gt;Programs, which may be used to start Graph.</font></p>

      
      <p><font size="+1">If an older version of Graph is already installed, you 
      can just install the new version over it. There is no need to uninstall 
      the old version first, but make sure Graph is not running while 
      installing. </font></p>

        languages for the user interface. This may later be changed from inside 
        the program.</font></p>
