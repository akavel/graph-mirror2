      <p align="center"><font size="+1">Why should you use Graph?<br>
       Here&nbsp;are some of the things Graph can do for you: </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1"><strong>Draw functions</strong><br>
        Graph can draw normal functions, parameter functions, and polar functions. 
        You can use a lot of built-in functions, e.g. sin, cos, log, etc. You 
        may specify color, width and line style of the graphs, and the graphs 
        may me limited to an interval. It is also possible to show a circle at 
        the ends indicating open or closed interval. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1"><strong>Draw relation</strong><br>
      Graph can show any equation and inequality, for example sin(x) &lt; cos(y) or x^2 + y^2 = 25. You can choose line width and color for the equations, and color and shading style for the inequalities. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1"><strong>Interact with other programs</strong><br>
  You can save the
  coordinate system with graphs as an image on disk either as a bitmap (bmp), 
        Potable Network Graphics (png), JPEG, metafile (emf) or Portable Document Format (PDF). You 
        may also copy the coordinate system into another program, e.g. Microsoft 
        Word, either as a normal image or as an OLE object, which may be edited 
        later by double clicking on it. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1"><strong>A lot of options</strong><br>
        While still easy to use Graph has a lot of customization possibilities, 
        e.g. fonts, colors, axes style, grids, etc. The axes, which may by normal 
        or logarithmic, can be placed either by entering specific values, or by 
        moving or zooming with the mouse. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1"><strong>Evaluate</strong><br>
        Given an x-coordinate Graph will calculate the function value and the 
        first two derivatives for any given function. Alternatively the function 
        may be traced with the mouse. Graph can also fill a table with evaluated 
        function coordinates in a user specified range. Data from the table can 
        easily be copied into another program, e.g. Microsoft Excel. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1"><strong>Calculate</strong><br>
        Graph can help you calculate the area under a function in a given interval 
        and the distance along the curve between two points on the function. The 
        program can also show the first derivative of a function, and create tangents 
        and normal lines to a function at given coordinates.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1"><strong>Point series and trendlines</strong><br>
        You can create series of points with different markers, colors and size. 
        Data for a point series can be imported from other programs, e.g. Microsoft 
        Excel. It is possible to create a line of best fit from the data in a 
        point series, either from one of the built-in models or from a user specified 
        model. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1"><strong>Shadings and labels</strong><br>
        Graph can insert shadings used to mark an area related to a function. 
        Shadings may be created with different styles and colors in a user specified 
        interval. In addition to the optional legend used to describe each function, 
        a label may be added anywhere in the system. A label can contain text 
        with different fonts, images and objects created in other programs.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="+1"><strong>Custom functions</strong><br>
      You can create your own custom 
      functions and constants for use in functions, relations, etc. You can for 
      example create a custom function sinc(x)=
            
                  
       sin(x)/x and a constant R=
                                   8.314510. You can when plot the function f(x)=R*sinc(x). </font></p></td>
