Compiler bug:
When compiling under C++ Builder XE, you will get this error:
[BCC32 Error] closures.hpp(237): E2299 Cannot generate template specialization from 'impl::closure_frame_holder<FrameT>'
To fix it, change line 237 in closures.hpp to:
impl::closure_frame_holder<closure_frame<ClosureT> >& frame;
