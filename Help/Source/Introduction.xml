			Graph is a program designed to draw graphs of mathematical functions in a coordinate system and similar things.
			The program is a standard Windows program with menus and dialogs.
			The program is capable of drawing standard functions, parametric functions, polar functions, tangents, point series, shadings and relations.
			It is also possible to evaluate a function for a given point, trace a graph with the mouse and much more.
