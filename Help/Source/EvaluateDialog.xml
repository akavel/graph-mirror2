			When

		<para>
			Below you can see the dialog, that appears when a standard function is selected.

		<para>
			You can enter a value for which you want to evaluate the function.
			The value will be evaluated for the function selected in the <glossterm>function list</glossterm>.
			If the result is on the graph within the shown coordinate system, it will be marked with a dashed cross.
			You can also trace the drawn graph with the mouse.
			Just click on the graph with the mouse and the function will be evaluated at the nearest point.
		</para>
		<para>
			It may happen that the result of an evaluation is a complex number with an imaginary part.
			This number will either be written as a+b&imag;, a&ang;&theta; or not written at all depending of the choice under <xref linkend="OptionsDialog"/>.

		<para>
			When
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Calc</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Area</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>
			is selected the dialog is used to calculate signed areas.
			This can only be done on standard functions, polar functions and tangents, but not on parametric functions.
			For standard functions, parametric functions and tangents the result is the signed area between the graph and the x-axis
			(the real x-axis and not necessarily the visible one) for the given range.
		</para>
		<para>
			For polar functions, the signed area is the one between the graph in the given range and origin.
			The area is considered negative when the angle goes from a higher to a lower value (clockwise).
		</para>
		<para>
			For the other functions the area is considered negative when the graph is below the x-axis or when the function goes from a higher to a lower x-value.
		</para>
		<para>
			You can either enter the range in the edit boxes or select the range with the mouse.
			The calculated area will be shown below the range, and the area will be marked with a shading in the coordinate system.
			The calculation is done using Simpson's formula through 1000 iterations.

			When

			is selected the dialog is used to calculate the distance between two points on the function along the curve.
			You may either enter the range in the dialog or use the mouse to mark it.
			The range will be marked in the coordinate system.
			The calculation is done by converting it to an integration and using Simpson's formula through 1000 iterations.
