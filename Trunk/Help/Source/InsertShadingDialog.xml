	<para>
		The dialog below is used to add shading to the selected function.
		The shading is used to mark an area between the function graph and something else.

	<graphic fileref="DialogShade1.png"/>

	<para>
		In the <guilabel>Shading</guilabel> tab you can choose between the following types of shadings:
	</para>

	<variablelist>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>Between function and x-axis</term>
			<listitem>
				This is the most commonly used type of shading.
				This will shade the area between the graph of the function and the x-axis in the selected interval.
				If you check <guilabel>decrease to intersection</guilabel> or <guilabel>increase to intersection</guilabel>,
				the interval will decrease or increase until the graph is crossing the x-axis.
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Between function and y-axis</term>
			<listitem>
				This will shade the area between the graph of the function and the y-axis in the selected interval.
				This is rarely used and probably most useful for parametric functions.
				Notice that you still use the x-coordinates for the interval.
				If you check <guilabel>decrease to intersection</guilabel> or <guilabel>increase to intersection</guilabel>,
				the interval will decrease or increase until the graph is crossing the y-axis.
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Below function</term>
			<listitem>
				This will shade the area below the graph of the function down to the bottom of the image in the selected interval.
				If you check <guilabel>decrease to intersection</guilabel> or <guilabel>increase to intersection</guilabel>,
				the interval will decrease or increase until the graph is crossing the bottom of the window.
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Above function</term>
			<listitem>
				This will shade the area above the graph of the function up to the top of the image in the selected interval.
				If you check <guilabel>decrease to intersection</guilabel> or <guilabel>increase to intersection</guilabel>,
				the interval will decrease or increase until the graph is crossing the top of the window.
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Inside function</term>
			<listitem>
				This will shade the area inside the graph of the function in the selected interval.
				If you check <guilabel>decrease to intersection</guilabel> or <guilabel>increase to intersection</guilabel>,
				the interval will decrease or increase until the graph is crossing itself.
				This is especially useful to shade a closed part of a parametric or polar function, but it can also be used to shade standard functions.
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Between functions</term>
			<listitem>
				This will shade the area between the graphs of two functions.
				The first function is the one you selected in the main window, before you invoked the dialog.
				The second function is selected in the list box in the <guilabel>2nd function</guilabel> tab.
				For standard functions, the interval will be the same for the two functions.
				For parametric functions, you may select different intervals for the two functions.
				If you don't select an interval for the second function, it will use the same interval as the first function.
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
	</variablelist>

	<para>
		At the <guilabel>options</guilabel> tab shown below, you may change the options for the shading.
	</para>

	<graphic fileref="DialogShade2.png"/>

	<variablelist>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>Start</term>
			<listitem>
				Here you may enter the x-coordinate or t-value if you are using parametric functions, where you want the shading to start.
				If you don't enter a value, the shading will start at minus infinity.
				If you place a check mark in <guilabel>decrease to intersection</guilabel>,
				the shadings start coordinate will be decreased from the entered value to the coordinate where the graph is crossing the axis,
				the edge, itself or another graph, depending of the shading type selected.
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>End</term>
			<listitem>
				Here you may enter the x-coordinate or t-value if you are using parametric functions, where you want the shading to stop.
				If you don't enter a value, the shading will continue until infinity.
				If you place a check mark in <guilabel>increase to intersection</guilabel>,
				the shadings end coordinate will be increased from the entered value to the coordinate where the graph is crossing the axis,
				the edge, itself or another graph depending of the shading type selected.
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Style</term>
			<listitem>
				Here you may choose between different styles to use for the shading.
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Color</term>
			<listitem>
				Here you may choose the color of the shading.
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Mark start of range</term>
			<listitem>
				Check this to draw a line at the start of the range.
				Uncheck it if you want two shadings to look as one.
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>Mark end of range</term>
			<listitem>
				Check this to draw a line at the end of the range.
				Uncheck it if you want two shadings to look as one.
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
	</variablelist>

	<para>
		At the <guilabel>2nd function</guilabel> tab,
		you may select the second function when you have chosen to create a shading between two functions in the <guilabel>Shading</guilabel> tab.
		This is only available when you have chosen <guilabel>Between functions</guilabel> in the <guilabel>Shading</guilabel> tab.
		The dialog with the <guilabel>2nd function</guilabel> tab is shown below.
	</para>

	<graphic fileref="DialogShade3.png"/>

	<variablelist>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>Shading range for 2nd function</term>
			<listitem>
				This is used to select the interval for the second function,
				just like you selected the interval for the first function in the <guilabel>Options</guilabel> tab.
				This is only available for parametric functions and not for standard functions.
				For standard functions the interval for the second function is always the same as the interval for the first function.
				If you enter neither a start nor an end of interval for a parametric function, the values for the first function will be used for the second function as well.
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
	</variablelist>

	<para>
		Shadings are a great way to mark an area, but if you get weird results, check that you selected the right function and the right interval.
		If you try to shade an interval crossing an asymptote or your shading is associated with a weird parametric function, you might get weird results.
		But really, what did you expect?
