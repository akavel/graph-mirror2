	<para>
		The dialog shown below is used to insert the first derivative of the selected function.
		If the function is a standard function, the first derivative is the slope of the function, and it is defined as the function differentiated with respect to x:
		<mathphrase>f'(x) = df(x)/dx</mathphrase>
