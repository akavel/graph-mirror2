			The installation will create a shortcut in the Start menu, which may be used to start the program. 
			Under the installation you can select the preferred language. This can later be changed from the 
			<xref linkend="OptionsDialog"/>.
		</para>
		<para>
			If an older version of the program is already installed, the installation suggests you install in the same directory. 
			You can just install over the old version. There is no need to uninstall the old version first, but make sure the old 
			version is not running while installing.
		</para>
		<para>
			Uninstallation is done from <emphasis>Add/Remove Programs</emphasis> in the <emphasis>Control Panel</emphasis>. 
			Just select Graph and click on the <emphasis>Change/Remove button</emphasis>. This will remove all traces of the program. 
			If files were added to the installation directory after the installation, you will be asked if you want to delete them. 
			Make sure the program is not running while uninstalling.
