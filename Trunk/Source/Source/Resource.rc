  634 "You can use Zoom|Fit to change the coordinate system to show all parts of the selected function or point series."                                          //Tip of the Day
  635 "When you hold down the Shift key you can drag the coordinate system around with the mouse."                                                                //Tip of the Day
  636 "You can use Calc|Evaluate to find intersections between functions, crossings with the axes and extremum points."                                           //Tip of the Day
  637 "When a point series is selected you can add points to it by clicking on the image while you hold down the Ctrl key."                                       //Tip of the Day
  638 "You can use a relation to plot any inequality, for example sin(x^2) < cos(y^2)"                                                                            //Tip of the Day
  639 "You can use a relation to plot any equation, for example x*sin x = y*cos y"                                                                                //Tip of the Day
  640 "Elements (functions, shadings, labels, relations, etc.) are drawn in the same order they appear in the function list to the left."                         //Tip of the Day
  641 "You can move the selected element in the function list either by dragging it with the mouse or with the arrow up/down keys while ALT is held down."        //Tip of the Day
  642 "You can show functions and other elements behind the axes by moving the element above the axes in the function list to the left. To move shadings and tangents you will have to move the functions they are attached to." //Tip of the Day
  643 "Custom text labels may be attached to the axes by right clicking on the label and selecting a placement from the context menu."                            //Tip of the Day
  644 "The legend may be moved freely with the mouse or attached to one of the corners by right clicking on the legend and choose a placement from the context menu." //Tip of the Day
  645 "As an alternative to Transparent, you can choose a custom background color for labels. This is especially useful for labels drawn over shadings."              //Tip of the Day
  646 "In most places like point series, axes settings, function ranges, etc., you can use expressions like pi/4 instead of numbers."                             //Tip of the Day
  647 "You can create your own custom constants under Function|Custom functions for use in functions, point series, etc. For example g=9.80665, R=8.31"           //Tip of the Day
  648 "You can create your own custom functions under Function|Custom functions for use in plotting functions, relations, etc. For example sinc(x)=if(x=0, 0, sin(x)/x)"  //Tip of the Day
  649 "In the Save as image dialog there is an Option button you can use to specify the image resolution. This is especially useful if you want a high resolution image." //Tip of the Day
  650 "Point series can have arrows as markers. A point series with arrows as markers and lines between the points can be used to show vectors."                  //Tip of the Day
