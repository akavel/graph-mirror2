- Document how to put Graph on a memory stick or server.
- Distribute binary zip package.
- Update web site.
+ Animations don't work under Windows Vista.
+ Save From and To animation range to grf file.
- Remove change list from Check for update.
- Replace max limit for animation with resize of animation.
- Save animation as a sequence of bitmap files.
- Preview of arrows are inconsistent with the way it is actually drawn.
- Saving animation frames doesn't work under Windows 98.
- Import/export user defined trendline models.
- Fix labels attached to axes when axes are boxed.

Graph 4.3
- Animation Player: Add buttons to move to first and last frame for easy compare.
- Link to GPL in About dialog.
+ Link to Graph Examples in Start menu.
- Make the avi files work in other players than MS Media Player (VideoLAN for example). See mails from Pär Smårs.
- Create PDF documentation.
- Convert EMF to PDF
- Convert EMF to SVG
- Add trendlines as TGraphElem derivative
- Add differentiations f'(x) as TGraphElem derivative
- Split Custom functions into Local/Global
- Select graph elements by clicking on them on the image.
+ Set TrackBar1->Frequency in Unit20
+ Improve speed in drawing relations, especially when printing.
- Improve the Integrate(), Sum(), etc. functions
- Printed axes are too thin (change axes width?)
+ Calculate area under parametric function.
+ Zoom|Square should be Checked/Unchecked item.
- Save unicode descriptions as UTF8.
+ Convert the rest of the components into Unicode.
- Open Office Formula doesn't work in Graph.
- The variable in shadings should be able to go backwards.
+ Show Visible as check boxes in tree list.
- Improve accuracy in eval of arc and area. See mail from Rafael Karrer at 19/02-07. Area under ln(x)/sqrt(x^3) for [2;100000] should be 4.
- Document limitations in arc and area calculations.
- Improve simplify in Func32. 
+ Convert a^(b/c) to powdiv(a,b,c)
+ Save animation setting (From, To, Step) in grf files.
- f(x)=ln(x) doesn't show optimal when not maximized.
- Is 0^0=1 still needed? Show warning?
- Make it possible to store configuration data in ini file instead of registry (Check for Graph.ini). This makes it easier to run Graph from a memory stick.
- Place labels left/bottom of graphing area (in boxed axes mode). [see email from Don Margerison at 31/12-07]

Graph 4.4
- Calculate area for inequalities. (Use area of pixels + more accuracy at the border of the inequality)
- Markers to mark specific coordinates (may be added from Calc|Evaluate)
- Add tangents from Calc|Evaluate.
- Enable use of codecs in avi files.
- Polar axes.
- Calc|Evaluate can find where a function intersects with itself.
- Calc|Evaluate should precalculate extremums and intersections.
- Report name of function that failed. 
- Add support for bookbarks (save zoom settings).
- Change relations to use the same algorithm as GrafEq. See p77-tupper.pdf.
- Add "Auto color" to color boxes in function, tangent diff, etc dialogs. 
- Rotate text labels with the mouse.
- Choose width of axes.
- Save as image: Lock aspect ratio.
- Store expressions in the Axes dialog, and not just the evaluated number.
- Add support for Python plugins.
- Make it possible to add Python code to text labels.
- Show element text (and legend) when cursor is over an element in the graphing area.

Graph 4.5
- Convert EMF to EPS
- Add a second toolbar with color, width, etc.
- Fix problems with avi files that cannot be played with all players.
- Add "Save frame as" to the animation player
- Major/minor ticks
- Fix overlapping numbers on the axes. (Scientific notation, what do other programs do?)
- Real boxed axes

Later
- Select elements by clicking on them in the graph area.
- Indicate the selected element in the graph area (to make it easier to identify the selected element)
- Change evaluations to use less stack space to allow for larger recursive functions and larger functions in general (see mail from Morten at 03-04-2007)
- Stack overflow causes Graph to disappear. The exception handler is probably using even more stack space.
- Point series labels should be placed so they don't overlap with the error bars.
- Improve the Automatic Draw type.
- Reimplement calc in Func32 for optimal speed.
- Show overlapping solid shadings/inequalities (use alpha blending?)
- Make solid shadings/inequalities transparent (alpha blending) so the axes can be seen behind them.

To be considered
- Reverse direction of axes.
- Make one of the axes invisible.
- Use mng files instead of avi (http://www.libpng.org/pub/mng/)
- List of common functions (like http://www.eclectasy.com/Fractal-Explorer/)
- Add placement and rotation settings to the label dialog.
- Select several elements in the function list. 
- Implement groups (and sub groups?) which functions and similar can be added to. This makes it easier to handle (copy, visible) several elements at once.
- More than one coordinate system in a grf file (like in Excel).
- Show min and max values on the axes (boxed only?)
- Export as AutoCad dwg files. See http://www.opendwg.org
- Scientific calculator.
- Show asymptotes.
+ Change "Zoom|All points" to "Zoom|Fit all"
- Use error bars when finding trendline.
- Allow the use of comma as decimal separator.
- Several axes in one coordinate system. (MS Excel: Secondary axes)
- Show Custom functions/constants dialog if there are undefined functions/constants used in Insert function dialog.
- Change zoom to not change Axes settings but similar to WYSIWYG.
- Group several elements in a subtree. (See email from Michael Boutte at 31-12-07)
- Improve algorithm for finding intersections between functions.
- More possibilities for control how numbers are shown.

Plugins:
- Cirlce item
- Convert points, i.e. pass through a function.
- Add custom names to axes, e.g. sqrt(2).
- Implement the erf(x) and erfc(x) functions. (See email from profesor de ciencias at 29/12-07)
