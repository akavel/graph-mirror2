Known bug:
1. Insert the relation "(x^2+y^2)^2 = (x^2-y^2)"
2. Edit the relation and press OK.
3. Now the Precision Control register is changed from 2 to 0 and all numbers are shown with a very low precision.

Graph 4.4
- Calculate area for inequalities. (Use area of pixels + more accuracy at the border of the inequality)
- Markers to mark specific coordinates (may be added from Calc|Evaluate)
- Add tangents from Calc|Evaluate.
- Enable use of codecs in avi files.
- Polar axes.
- Propability paper axes. (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_paper)
- Calc|Evaluate can find where a function intersects with itself.
- Calc|Evaluate should precalculate extremums and intersections.
- Report name of function that failed.
- Add support for bookbarks (save zoom settings).
- Change relations to use the same algorithm as GrafEq. See p77-tupper.pdf.
- Add "Auto color" to color boxes in function, tangent diff, etc dialogs.
- Rotate text labels with the mouse.

- Save as image: Lock aspect ratio.
- Store expressions in the Axes dialog, and not just the evaluated number.
- Add support for Python plugins.
- Make it possible to add Python code to text labels.
- Show element text (and legend) when cursor is over an element in the graphing area.
- Some way to autoguess the intial guess for custom trendlines. For sinusoidal it could be a=Ymean, b=(Ymax-Ymin)

Graph 4.5
- Convert EMF to EPS
- Add a second toolbar with color, width, etc.
- Fix problems with avi files that cannot be played with all players.
- Add "Save frame as" to the animation player
- Major/minor ticks
- Fix overlapping numbers on the axes. (Scientific notation, what do other programs do?)
- Real boxed axes

Later
- Select elements by clicking on them in the graph area.
- Indicate the selected element in the graph area (to make it easier to identify the selected element)
- Change evaluations to use less stack space to allow for larger recursive functions and larger functions in general (see mail from Morten at 03-04-2007)
- Stack overflow causes Graph to disappear. The exception handler is probably using even more stack space.
- Point series labels should be placed so they don't overlap with the error bars.
- Improve the Automatic Draw type.
- Reimplement calc in Func32 for optimal speed.
- Show overlapping solid shadings/inequalities (use alpha blending?)
- Make solid shadings/inequalities transparent (alpha blending) so the axes can be seen behind them.
- Specify exact coordiante distances, eg. 1 mm between ticks or 1 cm between grid lines.

To be considered
- Reverse direction of axes.
- Make one of the axes invisible.
- Use mng files instead of avi (http://www.libpng.org/pub/mng/)
- List of common functions (like http://www.eclectasy.com/Fractal-Explorer/)
- Add placement and rotation settings to the label dialog.
- Select several elements in the function list.
- Implement groups (and sub groups?) which functions and similar can be added to. This makes it easier to handle (copy, visible) several elements at once.
- More than one coordinate system in a grf file (like in Excel).
- Show min and max values on the axes (boxed only?)
- Export as AutoCad dwg files. See http://www.opendwg.org

- Show Custom functions/constants dialog if there are undefined functions/constants used in Insert function dialog.
- Change zoom to not change Axes settings but similar to WYSIWYG.

- Change Zoom in/out on x/y-axis icons to something more obvious.
- Create Zoom toolbar with Zoom in/out x/y-axis icons.
- In a grid with a selection, the place of the cursor is marked marked with blue, which may be confusing to some.
- Add a way to write notes, e.g. add a a tab to the Python interpretter frame. This could be used to write notes that don't belong in the image, like the text in "Solar system.grf".
- Show uncertainty for each calculated constand when creating a trendline. (See email from Mike Cohler)
- Create point series with polar data points.
- Create polar trendline from polar data points.

Plugins:
